#Topic: Create list of dates between begin and end date using a recursion

Beautiful example of how recursions can help you out in life :)

Say you wanna make a list of dates for customers such as give all the days between the beginning of a trip till the end of it and put it all in a table.

Pretty cool, just felt like sharing, have a nice day!	

 DECLARE @FirstDay date = '2024-05-07'

 DECLARE @LastDay date = '2024-05-15'



 ;WITH TripDates_CTE(TripDate) AS 

	(

		SELECT @FirstDay

		UNION ALL

		SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 1, TripDate) AS TripDate
		FROM TripDates_CTE
		WHERE TripDate < @LastDay

	)


SELECT @FirstDay AS FirstDayOfTrip, @LastDay AS LastDayOfTrip, TripDate
FROM TripDates_CTE;
